This is a simple API built in PHP

For this app, I had trouble writing the group by functionality in MySQL since I usually do db queries with an ORM. I wasn't sure if by group by, the assignment meant for me to use sql group by, or to group the data as an array by date.

(ex. 
(1-1-20) => 
(row1) => 
(name) => "xxx" (ticker) => "xxx"

(1-2-20) => 
(row1) => 
(name) => "xxx" (ticker) => "xxx"
)
